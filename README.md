# What does it take to host an awesome event?

MSPs are student technology leaders, empowered to build Microsoft communities on their campus and share their deep knowledge and passion for technology with their fellow classmates. Events can be a good way to build/improve technical ecosystem inside and outside your campus, and hosting a good ‘Microsoft-style’ event is not an easy task. So what it takes to host an awesome event? Here I am sharing some lessons I learned through being an MSP and handling a community of 1000+ students and professionals.

# 1) Start early!
Ideally, planning for campus level events should start at-least 15 before the actual event, whereas you should have at-least 30 days margin for city/region level events.

# 2) Have a backup! 
and maybe backup of backup. Sometimes things go wrong. Backup projector, backup mic, backup laptops backup venue, and maybe backup team members (yes!)

# 3) Be a networking machine! 
Once you have a plan, you will need to find your resources and people in your network can help you in setting up agenda, getting speakers, etc. Attend other events and build your professional network.

# 4) Lastly, stick to brand and MSP guidelines. 
Do not make assumptions and feel free to ask program owners/fellow MSPs for any help. 

Will be back soon with some more tricks and hacks to rock your next event!

Please share your views/event hacks in the comments below. What should be included in this list? I would love to hear from new and old MSPs about their experience, and then everything can be compiled in a blog post :)

Cheers and all the best!
